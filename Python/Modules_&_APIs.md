## Introduction
- **Classes** are a way to organize data and functionality together.
- **Modules** group related classes and data and make them accessible from one place.
- Python has a lot of built-in modules. The math module provides data like the value of pi and methods for different math operations.
   - To use a module, we import it with the keyword import  followed by the module's name, like here with import math.
   - To use the module, we add its name, followed by the method or data we want. Here we'll add math.sqrt(16) to call the square root method.
   - We can find out the functionality a module has by using the help() instruction with the name of the module between the parentheses.
   - **statistics** is another built-in module. It helps out with statistic functions like the mean of a list, like with mean(scores)
   - We're able to use multiple different modules in the same file by adding a comma between the modules we're importing.
