## Geospatial Technology:
It refers to the broad range of advanced tools and techniques used for acquiring, analysing, managing, and visualizing.

## Core Components of Geospatial Technology:
- Remote Sensing
- Geographic Information Systems --> (a software for managing and analysing spatial data)
- GNSS --> (Satellite based system providing precise location and time information globally)
- Cartography --> the science and art of creating maps
- Spatial Analysis

## Concepts of Remote Sensing:
- **Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMR):
  - **Classification based on EMR**:
    - **Optical Remote Sensing:** (0.4 - 2.5 mic m) --> UV & Visible --> Reflection
    - **Thermal remote Sensing:** (3-5/8-14) --> NIR & Thermal IR --> Emittance
    - **Microwave/Radar Remote Sensing:** --> Bands: Ku, X, C, S, L, P, I --> Back Scattering
   
## Active and Passive Remote Sensing;
Active RS works 24/7, while Passive RS works only during the day when a energy source is available.

# Satellite Orbits and Platforms:
1. Sun-Synchronous Orbit (aka Polar Orbit):
   - Orbits in such a way that the panel faces the sun, to generate energy
   - passes over places at the same local time.
   - low Earth orbit (160 - 2000 kms)
   - used majorly in Earth observations
2. Geostationary Orbit:
   - Prrox. 35,786 kms
   - Continuous real time monitoring

## Sensor Resolution
- **Spatial Resolution:** Refers to thr size of the smallest possible thing that can be sensed.
- **Radiometric Resolution:** The sensor's ability to differentiate between subtle differences in energy intensity
- **Spectral Resolution:** 

## Reflectance
