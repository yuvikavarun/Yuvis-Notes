## Geospatial Technology:
It refers to the broad range of advanced tools and techniques used for acquiring, analysing, managing, and visualizing.

## Core Components of Geospatial Technology:
- Remote Sensing
- Geographic Information Systems --> (a software for managing and analysing spatial data)
- GNSS --> (Satellite based system providing precise location and time information globally)
- Cartography --> the science and art of creating maps
- Spatial Analysis

## Concepts if Remote Sensing:
- **Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMR): 

## Sensor Resolution
- **Spatial Resolution:** Refers to thr size of the smallest possible thing that can be sensed.
- **Radiometric Resolution:** The sensor's ability to differentiate between subtle differences in energy intensity


## Reflectance
