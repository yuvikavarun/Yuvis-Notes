# Introduction:
ML is a branch of AI, concerns the construction and study of systems that canlearn from data.
It is about predicting the future based on the past.

## Machine Learning Process:
- Define Objective
- Dta Gathering
- Preparing Data
- Data Exploration
- Building a Model
- Model Evaluaion
- Prediction

## Epoch and Itration:
One epoch is one full read through of the entire dataset. And one iteration is one update step, one mini batch processed.

--> Iterations = No. of Samples/ batch size

# Types of Machine Learning:
1. **Supervised Learning:**
   We give it labeled exaples --> both input and output. It learns the mapping from input to output

     Error = Target output - Actual input
3. **Unsupervised Learning:**
   We provide raw data with no labels. The model finds out hidden patterns
4. **Reinforcement Learning:**
   This model learns by trial and errors

# Common Algorithms:
- **Regression:** If the output
