 # Earth Observations:
- Studying the Earth in an integrated way is essential to understanding the causes and consequenses of climate change and other global environmental concerns.
- We study the entire Earth systems to noyt just observe what is changing but also understand how changes in one of these systems impact all of the others.

## Why Study Earth from Space?
- **Global Observations:** Satellites help us collect information around the world including places which are hard to observe from the ground like vast oceans, trecherous glaciers and dense forests.
- **Reliability:** To provide accurate and reliable data.
- **Long Term Records:** Making routine measurements with the same instruments over these long time periods allow us to accurately tack changes in Earth's systems.
- **Data for Everyone:** Satellite data supports not just scientists, but also farmers, teachers, doctors, and more.
- **Cooperation:** NASA works with worldwide agencies to benefit everyone.

## How Earth Observations are Made:
Callibrated instruments allows scientists to measure a wide range of physical features for nearly every surface of Earth's land, water, and atmospheric systems based on how these fearures interact with electromagnetic radiation.

## What is Remote Sensing:
It is the process of collecting information about objects from a distance without being in physical contact with them.
- Remote sensing instruments are designed to detect specific sources of energy. They interpret these observations to provide data about objects on the Earth's surface and atmosphere.
- Scirntists refer to measureable properties within the Earth's systems as geophysical parameters.
- Most of the remote sensors that NASA uses to study the earth detect **electromagnetic radiation.**
- **Electromagnetic Radiation:** this is often referred to as light, electromagnetic energy, or electromagnetic waves. --> **Electromagnetic waves** can be described by their frequency, wavelength, and amplitude. All three describe a different property of light, yet they are related to each other mathematically.
  - **Wave Characteristics:**
      - _Frequency:_ It is the number of cycles (marked by crests) that pass a point in a given amount of time.
      - _Wave Length:_ It is the distance from one crest to the next, and is inversely proportional to frequency.
      - _Energy:_ The amount of energy in a wave increases as the frequency increases --> Longer wavelengths have less energy than the waves with shorter wavelengths.
      - _Amplitude:_ It is the measure of the wave from the rest point (centre line) to the crest (the top of the wave) or trough (the bottom of the wave)
      - _Intensity:_ It is a measurementt used in remote swensing which is proportional to the square of the amplitude.
  - **Wave Behaviors:**
    1. **Incident Radiation:** The incoming electromagnetic energy that hits a surface is calle dincident radiation.
       - Reflection
       - Absorbtion
       - Scatter
       - Emission
       - Transmission
    2. **Polarization:** It is another property of electromagnetic waves - the measurement of the electroagnetic field's alignment.
       _The plane and direction on whic they vibrate is their polarization_
       - If all the waves arre vibrating in the same direction, they are said to be polarized in that direction.
       - Electromagnetic waves can be polerized or depolarized when they interact with materials and surfaces with certain textures.

# The Electromagnetic Spectrum:
The electromagnetic spectrum ranges from very long wavelength, low frequency, low enerfy radio wave sto very short wavelength, high frequency, high energy gamma rays.
