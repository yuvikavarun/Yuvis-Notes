# Introduction
**Error:** A problem in the code that prevents it from running correctly.
**Exception:** An error that occurs during program execution (runtime error) and can be handled.

## Types of Errors
1. **Syntax Errors**
- Occur when code breaks Pythonâ€™s syntax rules.
- Detected before the program runs (during compilation/parsing stage).
- Example:
``` if True print("Hello")  #Missing colon ```

2. **Logical Errors**
- Code runs without crashing, but output is incorrect due to wrong logic.
- Example:
``` average = total * count  # Should be total / count ```
