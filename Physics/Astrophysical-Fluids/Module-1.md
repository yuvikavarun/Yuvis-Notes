# Introduction:
## What is Astrophysics?
Astrophysics is defined as the branch of physics dedicated to understanding the birth, evolution, destiny, and mutual interactions of celestial bodies like planets, stars, comets, nebulae, and galaxies. The course specifically focuses on the astrophysical fluid aspects and structural characteristics of astrophysical media, rather than the evolution of individual objects.
  
## Astrophysical Fluids and Scales
An astrophysical fluid refers to the fluid media relevant at astrophysical scales, which range from 100 Astronomical Units (AU) to 1 Parsec (pc). This translates to roughly 10^10 kilometers to 10^13 kilometers. These fluids can be neutral fluids or, more commonly, plasmas (ionized gases containing charged constituents like ions and electrons, and sometimes neutral atoms).

## Why Astrophysics is Attractive
Astrophysics is attractive because it is an observation-driven science that aims to explain observed phenomena. It is a confluence of six key domains of physics:
- **Classical Mechanics:** Essential for understanding particle motion.
- **Fluid Dynamics:** The primary focus of this course, building upon Newtonian mechanics.
- **Quantum Mechanics:** Relevant for compact objects (e.g., neutron stars, white dwarfs) due to effects like electron degeneracy pressure. (Not explicitly covered in this course).
- **Statistical Mechanics:** Used at the base level for deriving fluid equations, but not explicitly used afterward.
- **Electromagnetism:** Crucial because most astrophysical fluids are plasmas (charged fluids), requiring an understanding of plasma physics, which combines fluid dynamics and electromagnetism.
- **Relativity:** Important for high fluid velocities (relativistic jets) or strong gravitational fields (massive objects curving spacetime).

## Dynamical Theory in Physics
A dynamical theory is a formal framework for studying the evolution of a system over time. It consists of two main components:
1. State Variables: Quantities that describe the system's state at any given instant.
2. Law of Evolution: Equations (ordinary or partial differential equations) that describe how the state variables change with time.
   - Classical Mechanics: State variables are position and velocity; law of evolution is Newton's Laws.
   - Quantum Mechanics: State variable is the wave function (ψ); law of evolution is the Schrödinger equation.
   - Electrodynamics: State variables are electric and magnetic fields; law of evolution is Maxwell's equations.
