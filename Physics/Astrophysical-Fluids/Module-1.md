# Introduction:
- In astrophysics, fluids typically refer to gases and plasmas that flow and interact under the influence of gravity, pressure, magnetic fields, and radiation.
- Even though space is super huge and mostly empty, the matter in it flows, swirls, heats up, cools down, and reacts to forces, just like air or water does on Earth. This is why we use fluid physics to study how things move in space. We study them at different levels, depending on how detailed we want to get. Think of it like zooming in and out on a system:

## Dynamic Theory:
"Dynamical theory" just means the study of how things move and change over time. In the case of astrophysical fluids, it means understanding - how does all this gas and plasma in space move, flow, heat up, cool down, or collapse under gravity.
To study motion in space, scientists use different levels:
