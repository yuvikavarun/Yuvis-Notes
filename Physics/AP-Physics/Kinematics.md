# Kinematics
Kinematics is a branch of physics that deals with the motion of objects without considering the forces that cause the motion. It focuses on describing how things move. how far, how fast, in what direction, and how their motion changes over time.
Physical quantities in kinematics (and physics in general) are divided into two main types:

**1. Scalar quantities:**
- These have only magnitude (a numerical value).
- They do not have direction.
- eg: distance, speed, mass, temperature, time.

**2. Vector quantities**
- These have both magnitude and direction.
- Direction is essential in describing them.
- eg: displacement, velocity, acceleration, force.
